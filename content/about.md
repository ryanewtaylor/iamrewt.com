Hello, I'm Ryan.

I'm currently an Application Architect and have been programming professionally
since 2001. I really enjoy process improvement and recently I'm sinking my teeth
into DevOps and automation.

I'm also a gamer and have been playing video games since the NES. I dream of one
day developing my own indie game but haven't yet put my ideas to code. Someday I
will!
